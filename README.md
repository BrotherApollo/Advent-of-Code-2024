This is my solutions and failed attempts at Advent of code challenges. 

This repo will only contain the code used to generate my solutions. I need to figure out a way to mark if they worked or not lolol

folder structure is year/language

## Languages used by year

Year | Primary | Extra Languages | Notes
-|-|-|-
2015 | Python | Javascript | - 
2024 | Python  | - | 39 ★ ; First year DNF
2025 | TypeScript | Python, Rust | Stretch goal, complete in at least two languages

## Javascript
I am using p5 sketches for solving with Javascript. Add a `data.txt` file with you puzzle input to the folder.
Then run `python3 -m http.server 8000` to locally host the sketch.
